Create an execution plan, based on a PRD, and save it out to a file: ./plan.md

## The PRD

@prd.md


## Guidelines

- Create and save the execution plan as a file: ./plan.md
- The entire plan should have multiple phases
- Be sure to plan in phases, where each leaves a complete, fully functioning, and tested component of code
- Label phases that are dependent on each other
- Into each phase, implement a way to check your work so that you know you are done.
  - This could be software testing, computer-use tools, external bash scripts, etc
  - This must be an autonomous feedback loop
- Each phase should have a checklist of tasks
