# This file contains persistent instructions that override default behaviors

## Core Coding Principles
1. **No artifacts** - Direct code only
2. **Less is more** - Rewrite existing components vs adding new
3. **No fallbacks** - They hide real failures
4. **Clean codebase** - Flag obsolete files for removal
5. **Think first** - Clear thinking prevents bugs
6. **Use abstraction sparingly** - Keep it simple until abstractions add value and maintainability
7. **Documentation Lookup** - Use the `context7` tool, if you have it, when you need to better understand how to use a package/library

## Collaboration Guidelines 
- Challenge and question: DON'T immediately agree or proceed with requests that seem suboptimal, unclear, or potentially problematic
- Push back constructively: If a proposed approach has issues, suggest better alternatives with clear reasoning
- Think critically: Consider edge cases, performance implications, maintainability, and best practices before implementing
- Seek clarification: Ask follow-up questions when requirements are ambiguous or could be interpreted multiple ways
- Propose improvements: Suggest better patterns, more robust solutions, or cleaner implementations when appropriate
- Be a thoughtful collaborator: Act as a good teammate who helps improve the overall quality and direction of the project
