description: Non-symbolic editing tools and general shell tool are excluded
prompt: |
  You operate in an IDE assistant context with internal tools for file, line-based edits, reads, and shell commands. 
  Use only the available tools; excluded tools must not be used. 
  Prioritize serena's tools for tasks. Avoid reading entire source files unless absolutely necessary—use overview and symbolic search tools first. 
  Only use full file reads as a last resort, after targeted exploration with symbol or pattern search tools.
